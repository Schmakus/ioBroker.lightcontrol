# 1. Features

-   Use of mixed lamps/colour systems and conversion of colour systems (hex, rgb, xy)
-   Possibility to assign default values to each illuminant (same brightness despite differently powerful illuminant)
-   Use any number of motion sensors per group
-   Ramping (slow change of brightness to target value) for on and off
-   Dimming up and down
-   AutoOff by time / No off if motion;
-   AutoOff by brightness
-   AutoOn when moving from certain brightness
-   AutoOn in the dark

# 3. Configuration

If the checkbox "**_should close in the installation window, if finished_**" is not checked you have to close it.

The configuration window consists of the tabs:

-   [4. Group settings](#4-gruppen-einstellungen)
-   [5. Lights and Sensors](#5-lichter-und-sensoren)

# 4. Group Settings

The configuration window opens automatically with the group settings, where the individual light groups are created.

## 4.1 Light Groups

![Instance Settings - LightGroups](img/02_Instance_Settings_LightGroups.jpg)

Clicking on the + will create a new line.

-   Description: Here you name the group. Attention: Do not create dublicates!!
-   Individual lux sensor: Here you define an individual lux sensor. An object ID can be inserted via the 3 dots on the right side. If the field is left empty, the global lux sensor is used for the light group, if one is defined.

## 4.2 General Settings

![Instance Settings - General](img/01_Instance_Settings.jpg)

-   **Global lux sensor settings**
    -   This sensor is used globally unless an individual sensor has been selected within a group
    -   A numeric data point must be selected!
-   **Color temperature settings**
    -   Minimum value for color temperature in Kelvin => standard: 2700
    -   Maximum color temperature in Kelvin => Standard: 6500
-   **Dimming settings**
    -   Ramp steps for dimming => Default: 10
    -   Minimum brightness when dimming via the data point _DimmDown_ => Default: 10
-   **Presence settings**
    -   Object ID of presence => Must be _true_ or _false_
    -   Object ID of the attendance counter => Must be a number.
-   **Logging**
    -   Advanced user logging

# 5 Lights and Sensors

All lights and sensors are added to the light groups via the respective data points:

![Custom Configuration](img/07_customConfig_openSettings.jpg)

After opening the settings, the configuration must be activated:

![Activate Custom Config](img/03_activate_customConfig.jpg)

## 5.1 Lights

![Light Settings](img/04_customConfig_light.jpg)

-   **Type of object**
    In many cases, LightControl detects whether it is a light or sensor, if not, then \_Licht_is preset.

-   **Light group**
    Here you select the previously defined light groups in the instance settings (multiple selection possible -> bug)

-   **Light name**
    Define a name for the light Previously defined names are suggested for selection

-   **Function of object**
    In many cases, LightControl detects which function it could be. If the automatic detection does not correspond to what is desired, then select the respective function via the DropDown menu

## 5.2 Sensors

### 4.2.1 General

-   When a sensor triggers, the light is switched (if activated in the data points).
-   Only when ALL sensors no longer register, the switch-off process is started (if activated in the data points).

> Note: Theoretically, switches can also be specified here, as long as there are different values for on/off. However, the shutdown process depends on the setting, for example, light goes off after 60 seconds

![Custom Config Sensor](img/08_customConfig_sensor.jpg)

-   Value for Motion - _Value for motion detected; e.g., true_
-   Value for noMotion - _Value for no movement, e.g., false_

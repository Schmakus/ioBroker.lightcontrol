# 2. Installation

The adapter is in the test phase and is not yet released by ioBroker.
To install you have to go to the ioBroker adapter tab and click on the "Cat" (expert setting) "Custom".
Then add the Github link: [https://github.com/Schmakus/ioBroker.lightcontrol.git](https://github.com/Schmakus/ioBroker.lightcontrol.git).

After the download you can click on the (+) an instance.

# 3. Configuration

If the checkbox "**_should close in the installation window, if finished_**" is not checked you have to close it.

The configuration window consists of the tabs:

-   [4. Group settings](#4-gruppen-einstellungen)
-   [5. Lights and Sensors](#5-lichter-und-sensoren)

# 4. Group Settings

The configuration window opens automatically with the group settings, where the individual light groups are created.

## 4.1 Light Groups

![Instance Settings - LightGroups](img/02_Instance_Settings_LightGroups.jpg)

Clicking on the + will create a new line.

-   Description: Here you name the group. Attention: Do not create dublicates!!
-   Individual lux sensor: Here you define an individual lux sensor. An object ID can be inserted via the 3 dots on the right side. If the field is left empty, the global lux sensor is used for the light group, if one is defined.

## 4.2 General Settings

![Instance Settings - General](img/01_Instance_Settings.jpg)

-   **Global lux sensor settings**
    -   This sensor is used globally unless an individual sensor has been selected within a group
    -   A numeric data point must be selected!
-   **Color temperature settings**
    -   Minimum value for color temperature in Kelvin => standard: 2700
    -   Maximum color temperature in Kelvin => Standard: 6500
-   **Dimming settings**
    -   Ramp steps for dimming => Default: 10
    -   Minimum brightness when dimming via the data point _DimmDown_ => Default: 10
-   **Presence settings**
    -   Object ID of presence => Must be _true_ or _false_
    -   Object ID of the attendance counter => Must be a number.
-   **Logging**
    -   Advanced user logging

# 5 Lights and Sensors

All lights and sensors are added to the light groups via the respective data points:

![Custom Configuration](img/07_customConfig_openSettings.jpg)

After opening the settings, the configuration must be activated:

![Activate Custom Config](img/03_activate_customConfig.jpg)

## 5.1 Lights

![Light Settings](img/04_customConfig_light.jpg)

-   **Type of object**
    In many cases, LightControl detects whether it is a light or sensor, if not, then \_Licht_is preset.

-   **Light group**
    Here you select the previously defined light groups in the instance settings (multiple selection possible -> bug)

-   **Light name**
    Define a name for the light Previously defined names are suggested for selection

-   **Function of object**
    In many cases, LightControl detects which function it could be. If the automatic detection does not correspond to what is desired, then select the respective function via the DropDown menu

    <img src="img/06_customConfig_funcOfObject.jpg" width="200">

    -   **Switch**

        -   Power On Value - _value for exampletrue_
        -   Power Off Value - _value for examplefalse_

    -   **Brightness**

        -   Value for minimum brightness - _value the lowest brightness.eg0_
        -   Value for maximum Brightnes - _value for maximum brightness.eg100_
        -   Value/Offset for Brightness - _value in percent for adjusting the brightness against the other lamps within the group. 100 = no adjustment // 50 = half as hell_
        -   Use brightness to switch the lamp (still without function)

    -   **Color-Temperature**

        -   Value for minimum Color-Temperature - _Value warm white.eg250_
        -   Value for maximum Color-Temperature - _value for cold white, for example452_
        -   Send color temperature directly to lamp (still without function)

    -   **Saturation**

        -   Value for minimum saturation - _value for the lowest saturation.eg0_
        -   Value for maximum saturation - _value for maximum saturation.eg100_
        -   Send saturation directly to lamp (still without function)

    -   **ModeSwitch**

        -   Value for White Mode - _Value for White Mode, e.g., false_
        -   Value for Color Mode - _value for the color mode, e.g., true_

    -   **Color**
        -   Color Type - _Type of color specification (HEX => #FFFFFF // RGB => 255,255 // XY => [0.4992,0.418])_
        -   Default Value for Color- _Default value, e.g., #FFFFFF_
        -   Send color directly to lamp (still without function)

## 5.2 Sensors

### 4.2.1 General

-   When a sensor triggers, the light is switched (if activated in the data points).
-   Only when ALL sensors no longer register, the switch-off process is started (if activated in the data points).

> Note: Theoretically, switches can also be specified here, as long as there are different values for on/off. However, the shutdown process depends on the setting, for example, light goes off after 60 seconds

![Custom Config Sensor](img/08_customConfig_sensor.jpg)

-   Value for Motion - _Value for motion detected; e.g., true_
-   Value for noMotion - _Value for no movement, e.g., false_
